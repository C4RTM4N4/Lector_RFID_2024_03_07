The service will start upon the start of the windows machine (no login necessary). Once active it will 
monitor the configured folder for the creation of .csv files. Once a new .csv file is created it reads 
the 3th line from it and extracts the departure UTC time of the measured unit. For each new .csv file it 
will generate a new file with the same name plus _tag.json on the same folder. This file will contain 
the tag read since the departure time of the unit in json format.  After a correct file upload to AURA,
the two files will be zipped together and move to the ./meassured folder. If there is an error in the 
meassurement the two files will be movet to the ./uploaderror folder. 
  
Logging of errors and information is redirected to the windows Event Viewer. 


 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 To install the rfid service, follow the next instructions:
- Open a command line windows (cmd) and cd into the directory containing the setup.bat installation script.
- Execute the setup.bat script and follow the on screen instructions. 
The script will ask for the director where the rfid binary and configuration file will be located. 
After that the files will be copied to that location and the service 

will be registered.  
By default this service is installed with the LOCAL SERVICE account. This account must be added to the accounts 
able to modify and control de folder where the csv files will be created. Another way to grant access to the folder 
is to change the service account; this can be changed from the windows service controller (services.msc). If 
the default account is change it must be to an account that has also network access capabilities.
